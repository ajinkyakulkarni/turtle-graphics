* turtle graphics
** usage
   start the app with:
   lein figwheel
   open a browser to:
   http://localhost:3449/cards.html

   from the fighweel repl, go into a namespace:
   (in-ns 'turtle-graphics.turtles.square.turtle)

   and run turtle programs:
   (run-program (circle-dance :lt-green :lt-blue :lt-red :lt-purple) 1000)

   open browser developer tools,
   to see turtle commands being processed in console
   and generated svg in html

** introduction
   an svg turtle
   with a position and a heading
   and some style, a stroke and a fill color
   and a set of commands
   that can make paths,
   that can be stoked or filled,
   and transformed

   turtle-paths

   a turtle and a set of commands
   commands are sent to the turtle
   causing it to change its postion, heading, or style

   with each command the program changes state
   and a new view is rendered
   using hiccup style markup with reagent and react

   commands include: move, turn, resize, repeat, recur, path
   programs composed of the basic commands, like
   circle, point,  polygon, star, sierpensky

** turtle state
   the turtle state consists of a position and a heading

   the position is a point in the plane
   the heading is a 2d vector

   the heading and position are changed by turtle commands
** turtle commands
   as data, hiccup style
   [:move d]
   [:forward d]
   [:turn a]
   [:resize s]

    as data, clojure records
    (->Move d)
    (->Forward d)
    (->Left)
    (->Right)
    (->Circle color)
    (->Point point)
    (->Resize s)

** svg rendering
   [:svg {:width 200 :height 200}
     [:defs
       [:path {:d path-string}]
       [:clip]]
     [:circles ...]
     [:paths ...]]

** svg commands
   svg path commands as data structures
   [:M position]
   [:m vector]
   [:circle style]
   [:path {:id path-name} path-data]
** turtle programs
   an initial turtle-state
   a sequence of turtle commands

   each command alters the turtle's state
   and draws to the screen

** program execution
   create named path with id in defs element
   that draws the turtle shell
   and can then be transformed according to position and heading
   to where ever the turtle may be
   the turtle carries it's shell with it, as you know
   and it's own coordinate system
** turtle art
   collected in galleries

** turtle geometry
** turtle habitats
*** svg-turtle
    this turtle lives in an svg document that can either be a standalone file or
    be embedded in an html web page rendered using react
*** canvas-turtle
    this turtle lives in an html5 canvas
    both in two-dimensions and three, making use of web-gl

*** processing-turtle
*** electron-turtle
** famous turtles
*** turtle robot
    on the floor of the mit ui department
    and then onto the screen as a virtual turtle
*** mythical turtle
    the story behind the turtle robot,
    a work of pure fiction where
    the turtle charater of our stories meets and inspires
    Jean Praget and Seymour Papert
    who then goes on to invent the
    famous LOGO turtle in mathland
    helping children to learn programming and mathematics
    turtle geometry
*** complex turtle
    this turtle is not famous, but is the star of this application

    this turtle lives in the complex plane using
    complex numbers to represent
    its position and heading
    and the processing of turtle commands employ
    additon and multiplication of complex numbers

    geometric interpretations of complex addition and multiplication
    become tangible
    as the learner interacts
    with this complex turtle

    this turtle also has some special powers.
    above and beyond traditional turtles

    circles are fundamental
    as are lines

    this turtle can show how a line is like a circle with infinate radius
*** affine turtle
    this is the standard turtle,
    whose natural home is the affine plane
*** projective turtle
    central and paralell projections
    with a pair of turtles

    to explore projective geometry
    the projective plane
    and projective space

    using homogeneous coordinates

*** hyperbolic turtle
    this turtle explores hyperbolic space
