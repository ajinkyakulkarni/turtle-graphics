* turtle graphics
** introduction
   an svg turtle in clojure
   with a position and a heading
   and some style
   and a set of commands
   that can make paths,
   that can be stoked or filled,
   and transformed

   turtle-paths

   a turtle and a set of commands
   commands are sent to the turtle
   causing it to change its postion, heading, or style

   with each command the program changes state
   and a new view is rendered
   using hiccup style markup with reagent and react

   there are commands to move, turn, resize, repeat, recur, path
   and programs composed of the basic commands, like
   circle, polygon, star, sierpensky

** turtle state
** turtle commands
   [:move d]
   [:forward d]
   [:turn a]
   [:resize s]

   [:repeat n ...]

   as data, hiccup style

   and as funtions

** svg rendering
   [:svg]
   [:path {:d path-string}]
   [:clip]
   [:defs]

** turtle programs
   an initial turtle-state
   a sequence of turtle commands

   each command alters the turtle's state
   and draws to the screen

** program execution
   create named path with id in defs element
   that draws the turtle shell
   and can then be transformed according to position and heading
   to where ever the turtle may be
   the turtle carries it's shell with it, as you know
